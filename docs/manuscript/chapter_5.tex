\chapter{Discussion}

\label{chapter:discussion}

In this chapter, we interpret the results described from the previous chapter
and discuss their implications in order to answer our research questions.
Similar to the previous chapter, we break this chapter into three sections with
each section addressing one research question. Aside from answering the research
questions, we also gather interesting observations and propose hypotheses which could
motivate future research.

\section{RQ1: Evaluating performance of SoPa++}

To answer our first research question on whether \ac{spp} can deliver competitive
performance on the \ac{fmtod} English language intent classification task, we compare
the mean performance metrics of our \ac{spp} models against those from other
recent studies as mentioned in Section \ref{section:fmtod_performance}.
Referring to our accuracy ranges from Table \ref{tab:results_evaluation}, we
observe that the \ac{spp} models show a mean accuracy range of 97.6-98.3$\%$ for the
best performing models given their respective sizes. This falls into the general
accuracy range of 96.6-99.5$\%$ observed in other studies as per Table
\ref{tab:fmtod_examples}; albeit in the lower end of this spectrum. We can
therefore conclude that \ac{spp} offers competitive performance on the \ac{fmtod}'s
English language intent classification task.

While \ac{spp}'s performance range falling in the lower end of the aforementioned
spectrum can be seen as disadvantageous, it is worth noting that the models
\ac{spp} is being compared against are vastly different. For one, the \ac{bert}
models shown in Table \ref{tab:fmtod_results} had parameter counts ranging from
$\sim$110-340 million parameters \citep{devlin-etal-2019-bert}; which are
$\sim$100-300 times larger than our \ac{spp} models. In addition, models from
\citet{zhang-etal-2020-intent} showed an exceptionally high accuracy of 99.5$\%$
mainly because of pre-training on the external WikiHow data set for general
intent classification tasks. Finally, many of the models described in Table
\ref{tab:fmtod_results} were jointly trained on both \ac{fmtod} intent classification
and slot filling tasks; which could have contributed to certain joint-task
performance benefits. These significant differences between \ac{spp} and the
aforementioned models should be taken into account when comparing \ac{spp}'s
performance with other studies. 

\section{RQ2: Evaluating explanations by simplification}

To answer our second research question on whether \ac{spp} provides effective
explanations by simplification, we summarize the minimum differences in \ac{spp}
and \ac{re} proxy model pair performance metrics; as well as the minimum
distance metrics observed as per Table \ref{tab:explain_evaluate_performance}.
Regarding performance metrics, we observe the lowest accuracy score differences
to be 0.7$\%$ for small-sized models, 0.2$\%$ for medium-sized models and 0.1$\%$ for
large-sized models. Regarding distance metrics, we observe the lowest
$\overline{\delta_{\sigma}}$ and $\overline{\delta_{b}}$ to be 10.0$\%$ and
12.4$\%$ for small-sized models, 5.8 $\%$ and 13.5$\%$ for medium-sized models
and 4.3$\%$ and 14.2$\%$ for large-sized models respectively. These minimum
performance metric differences and distance metrics are typically observed with
larger $\tau$-thresholds ranging from 0.50-1.00. Unlike the case for RQ1, we do
not have an objective range of competitive accuracy differences or distance
metrics to compare against with other studies. As a result, our interpretation
of the effectiveness of the explanations by simplification technique will be
subjective. That being said, we still believe that accuracy differences as low
as 0.1$\%$ and softmax distance norms as small as 4.3$\%$ provide significant
evidence towards a high degree of resemblance between \ac{spp} and \ac{re} proxy
models. In summary, we find that the explanations by simplification post-hoc
explainability technique in \ac{spp} is effective, in particular for medium and
large-sized models with $\tau$-thresholds ranging from 0.50-1.00.

In the interest of objectivity, we would like to provide some perspectives in
which the explanations by simplification technique is not effective. For one,
explanations by simplification as a post-hoc explainability technique as per
Definition \ref{def:explain_simplify} explicitly requires the simplified proxy
model to be more transparent than its antecedent counterpart. While we made a
case for the transparency of the \ac{re} proxy model in Section
\ref{section:re_transparency}, one could also provide arguments for the \ac{re} proxy
model being non-transparent; especially when the \ac{re} lookup layer contains too
many regular expressions for a human to comprehend. This could indeed be the
case for medium and large-sized \ac{re} proxy models which have \ac{re} lookup layers
containing tens of thousands of "activating" regular expressions. In cases such,
it would not be possible for a human to understand all of the regular
expressions; which could ultimately render the \ac{re} proxy model as yet another
black-box model. In such cases, the explanations by simplification post-hoc
explainability technique would likely be ineffective.

With these arguments set aside, we now proceed to discuss some interesting
observations in regards to our results for RQ2. Firstly, we can observe the
performance-interpretability tradeoff from Section
\ref{section:performance_interpretability_tradeoff} in Table
\ref{tab:explain_evaluate_performance} with the more transparent \ac{re} proxy
models almost always performing worse than their black-box \ac{spp}
counterparts. Next, as per Table \ref{tab:explain_evaluate_performance}; we
observe that \ac{re} proxy models tend to perform better as the $\tau$-threshold
increases. We hypothesize that this occurs mainly because larger
$\tau$-threshold forces the memorization of higher scoring paths which
ultimately reduces the chances of the \ac{re} proxy model memorizing superfluous
or unimportant regular expressions in the \ac{re} lookup layer. Finally as per
Figure \ref{fig:explain_evaluate}, we observe that the $\overline{\delta_{b}}$
metric continues to decrease as the $\tau$-threshold increases, while the
$\overline{\delta_{\sigma}}$ metric plateaus beforehand and then slightly
increases. This could be seen as counter-intuitive, since more similar
\ac{tauste} binary vectors should imply more similar softmax distributions. It
would be interesting to further explore these trends with even higher
$\tau$-thresholds.

\section{RQ3: Interesting and relevant explanations}

\label{section:discussion_regex}

To answer our third research question on interesting and relevant explanations
derived from \ac{spp} on the \ac{fmtod} data set, we refer back to our results for this
research question and attempt to interpret them. Since this research question is
more open-ended than the previous two, our approach to answer it will also be
opinionated and subjective. One interesting observation is in the relative
linear weights applied to the \ac{tauste} neurons in Figure \ref{fig:neuron_weights}.
We can observe that weights are generally continuously distributed across all
neurons; with some exceptions such as neurons 19, 25 and 17 where the weights
are more skewed towards the alarm, reminder and weather domains respectively.
This implies that \ac{spp} and \ac{re} proxy models still distribute feature
importance across \ac{tauste} neurons in a highly connective sense; which also implies that
each \ac{tauste} neuron has a non-negligible impact on all classification decisions.

With the identification of the salient \ac{tauste} neurons 19, 25 and 17 specializing
in the alarm, reminder and weather domains respectively; we draw out ten regular
expression samples from the \ac{re} lookup layer corresponding to each of these neurons
as reflected in Figures \ref{fig:regex_example_neuron_alarm},
\ref{fig:regex_example_neuron_reminder} and
\ref{fig:regex_example_neuron_weather} respectively. To extract interesting and
relevant explanations, we attempt to interpret these sampled regular
expressions. Firstly, we can observe a segmentation of lexical information
between the regular expressions corresponding to these neurons. For example,
many of the regular expressions corresponding to neuron 19 use words related to
alarms such as \textit{"snooze"} and \textit{"clock"}; while those corresponding to neuron 17 use
words related to weather such as \textit{"fahrenheit"} and \textit{"forecast"}. Next, we can
observe transition branching in sampled regular expressions across
all three \ac{tauste} neurons. This branching phenomenon is interesting because words
in these branches can sometimes have very similar lexical semantics. For
example, in the third regular expression from the bottom in Figure
\ref{fig:regex_example_neuron_weather}, we observe branching with three
different digital tokens \textit{"44"}, \textit{"70"} and \textit{"67"} which
represent the temperatures encountered in the training data. Similarly, the
third regular expression from the top in Figure
\ref{fig:regex_example_neuron_weather} shows branching with the tokens
\textit{"atlanta"}, \textit{"omaha"} and \textit{"hawaii"}, which all represent
locations in the USA encountered in the training data. Finally, we can observe
interesting positional, or possibly syntactic, features in the regular
expressions in Figures \ref{fig:regex_example_neuron_alarm} and
\ref{fig:regex_example_neuron_reminder}; which all have a $\omega$-transition in
the same position.

Finally, the sampled regular expressions allow us to identify various inductive
biases incorporated by \ac{spp} and its \ac{re} proxy models from the training data.
Going back to the digital and location-based tokens mentioned in the previous
paragraph, we can observe how the training data induces USA-centric biases
pertaining to locations such as \textit{"atlanta"} and hard-coded Fahrenheit
temperatures such as \textit{"70"}. As a result, we can extrapolate that the
\ac{spp} and \ac{re} proxy models will likely only perform well on unseen data based in
USA-centric domains since they likely would not have encountered tokens from
non-USA-centric domains. An advantageous aspect of the \ac{re} proxy model is that
these inductive biases can be easily identified and also corrected. In the case
of correcting USA-centric locations, we could manually add more non-USA-based
locations in the branching transition of the third regular expression from the
top in Figure \ref{fig:regex_example_neuron_weather}. Another possible inductive
bias could be in the third regular expression from the top in Figure
\ref{fig:regex_example_neuron_alarm}, where the first transition only allows for
the pronoun \textit{"i"}. This inductive bias could be corrected in the \ac{re} proxy
model by augmenting it with all other pronouns available in the English
language. Finally, we can propagate these manual corrections in the \ac{re} proxy
model back to \ac{spp} by copying the word embeddings and transition matrix
diagonals of the biased word to now represent those of the manually added new
words.
