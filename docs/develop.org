** Tasks
*** Research
**** Clean code and documentation
***** TODO major code refactoring with conversion to latest PyTorch and CUDA versions
****** remove all boilerplate code and keep simplest version -> consider forking to retain license
****** incoporate useful SOPs such as namespace saving and printing
****** replace start and end pad token proxies with real =[PAD]= tokens which should be ignored by the RNN
***** TODO choose exact data set and set up workflow to download and pro-process it
***** current slurm considerations:
****** activate cuda-8.0 in sbatch scripts explicitly
****** use debug mode and low runtime for quick slurm runs
****** make list of all useful commands for slurm
***** update metadata in scripts later with new workflows, eg. with help scripts, comments describing functionality and readme descriptions for git hooks
***** add MIT license when made public

**** SoPa++
***** extensions:
****** leverage dynamic sub-word-level embeddings from recent advancements in Transformer-based language modeling.
****** modify the architecture and hyperparameters to use more wildcards or self-loops, and verify the usefulness of these in the mimic WFSA models.
****** modify the output multi-layer perceptron layer to a general additive layer, such as a linear regression layer, with various basis functions. This would allow for easier interpretation of the importance of patterns without the use of occlusion.
****** test SoPa++ on multi-class text classification tasks 
      
**** SoPa
***** goods: practical new architecture which maps to RNN-CNN mix via WFSAs, decent code quality in PyTorch (still functional), contact made with author and could get advice for possible extensions
***** limitations:
****** SoPa utilizes static word-level token embeddings which might contribute to less dynamic learning and more overfitting towards particular tokens
****** SoPa encourages minimal learning of wildcards/self-loops and $\epsilon$-transitions, which leads to increased overfitting on rare words such as proper nouns
****** while SoPa provides an interpretable architecture to learn discrete word-level patterns, it is also utilizes occlusion to determine the importance of various patterns. Occlusion is usually a technique reserved for uninterpretable model architectures and contributes little to global explainability
****** SoPa was only tested empirically on binary text classification tasks
***** issues:
****** unsure what self-loops and fwd-1s mean in output of =visualize.py= -> GitHub issue made to request for more information: https://github.com/Noahs-ARK/soft_patterns/issues/8 
***** general: likely higher performance due to direct inference and less costly conversion methods
      
**** Data sets
***** NLU data sets -> single sequence intent classification, typically many classes involved -> eg. ATIS, Snips, AskUbuntuCorpus, FB task oriented dataset (mostly intent classifications)
***** SOTA scores for NLU can be found on https://github.com/nghuyong/rasa-nlu-benchmark#result
***** vary training data sizes from 10% to 70% for perspective on data settings

**** Constraints
***** work with RNNs only
***** seq2cls tasks -> eg. NLU/NLI/semantic tasks, try to work with simpler single (vs. double) sequence classification task
***** base main ideas off peer-reviewed articles 

**** Research questions
***** Does the improved SoPa++ implementation contribute to competitive performance on NLU tasks? 
***** Does the improved SoPa++ implementation contribute to improved explainability by simplification?

** Legacy
*** Interpretable RNN architectures
**** State-regularized-RNNs (SR-RNNs)
***** good: very powerful and easily interpretable architecture with extensions to NLP and CV
***** good: simple code which can probably be ported to PyTorch relatively quickly
***** good: contact made with author and could get advice for possible extensions
***** problematic: code is outdated and written in Theano, TensorFlow version likely to be out by end of year
***** problematic: DFA extraction from SR-RNNs is clear, but DPDA extraction/visualization from SR-LSTMs is not clear probably because of no analog for discrete stack symbols from continuous cell (memory) states
***** possible extensions: port state-regularized RNNs to PyTorch (might be simple since code-base is generally simple), final conversion to REs for interpretability, global explainability for natural language, adding different loss to ensure words cluster to same centroid as much as possible -> or construct large automata, perhaps pursue sentiment analysis from SR-RNNs perspective instead and derive DFAs to model these
**** Rational recurences (RRNNs)
***** good: code quality in PyTorch, succinct and short
***** good: heavy mathematical background which could lend to more interesting mathematical analyses
***** problematic: seemingly missing interpretability section in paper -> theoretical and mathematical, which is good for understanding
***** problematic: hard to draw exact connection to interpretability, might take too long to understand everything
**** Finite-automation-RNNs (FA-RNNs)
***** source code likely released by November, but still requires initial REs which may not be present -> might not be the best fit
***** FA-RNNs involving REs and substitutions could be useful extensions as finite state transducers for interpretable neural machine translation

*** Interpretable surrogate extraction
***** overall more costly and less chance of high performance       
***** FSA/WFSA extraction
****** spectral learning, clustering
****** less direct interpretability
****** more proof of performance needed -> need to show it is better than simple data learning

*** Neuro-symbolic paradigms
***** research questions:
****** can we train use a neuro-symbolic paradigm to attain high performance (similar to NNs) for NLP task(s)?
****** if so, can this paradigm provide us with greater explainability about the inner workings of the model?

*** Neural decision trees
***** decision trees are the same as logic programs -> the objective should be to learn logic programs
***** hierarchies are constructed in weight-space which lends itself to non-sequential models very well -> but problematic for token-level hierarchies
***** research questions:
****** can we achieve similar high performance using decision tree distillation techniques (by imitating NNs)?
****** can this decision tree improve interpretability/explainability?
****** can this decision tree distillation technique outperform simple decision tree learning from training data?

*** Inductive logic on NLP search spaces
***** can potentially use existing IM models such as paraphrase detector for introspection purposes in thesis
***** n-gram power sets to explore for statistical artefacts -> ANNs can only access the search space of N-gram power sets -> solution to NLP tasks must be a statistical solution within the power sets which links back to symbolism
***** eg. differentiable ILP from DeepMind
***** propositional logic only contains atoms while predicate/first-order logic contain variables
