** Tasks
*** Current
**** Tasks pre-writing
     DEADLINE: <2021-02-21 Sun>
***** Cross-model comparisons
****** compare neural and regex model as two model inputs in total, create output with all exhaustive numbers required for later -> output model (softmax) scores, along with explanatory text/regex
****** use it to optimize compression techniques and other regex OOP generalization tricks
***** Simplification and compression
****** Improve the baseline compression method with nearest neighbours
******* EITHER needs more features from simplification such as nearest neighbours OR generate them with access to the model again -> use comparison scripts to determine which improvements are necessary
******* add back =k_best= to argument parser in case it is needed
******* handle *UNK* tokens on new data for mimic model -> perhaps look for best possible match given context
****** Explore improving/creating new compression methods
******* think of semantic clustering with digits or time or other means -> if there are no wildcards present
******* look into similar regular expressions *across separate* patterns and if this can be optimized somehow
******* think of how to aggregate compression, perhaps it is indeed possible to stack them
***** Regex OOP
****** find tricks to handle *UNK* tokens, which could be related or delegated to compression techniques
****** find tricks which help to increase generalization such as defaulting to patterns given nearest neighbours or levenstein distance

**** Tasks intra-writing
***** Visualization
****** Cross-model comparisons
******* visualize examples where regex and neural model align and misalign
****** Regex OOP
******* add visualization of regex ensemble with graphviz -> can specify which pattern to visualize and how to make large scale visualizations
****** Model runs
******* add visualizations of model runs using dedicated functions, preferably all using python libraries
****** SoPa++ computational graph
******* add visualization of computational graph function directly to sopa torch model
***** Dedicated modelling
****** replace =bias_scale= argument default with 1.0 since it is used outside of the semiring, might be more descriptive to have it that way instead of =None=
****** vary tau argument in grid search and use values in range from 0.25-0.75
****** remove Heaviside name from STE for simplicity -> change citation to 2013 paper which is more fundamental: https://arxiv.org/abs/1308.3432
****** make custom normalizer module to dynamically ignore infinities instead of expecting fixed sizes -> requires some new code to be written and autograd must be tested
****** consider using a generic function for batch minima, since this could be dependent on the semiring
****** change frequency of tensorboard, evaluation and model saving to update-level
******* update arg parser with new arguments
******* update train_inner with new workflow for saving/loading information
******* update save checkpoint code with required information
******* shift torch hooks around to be more sensible
******* convert data object to generator
******* encourage learning of wildcards by increasing its scale factor default -> in case there are not enough
******* think again about removing binarizer if it limits freedom of model too much
******* repeat grid-search with multiple random seeds -> do this after all changes and run code multiple times to maximize GPU memory usage
***** Speed of explainability execution
****** attempt to multi-thread all regex-related scripts
****** find out if individual compiled regex or full compiled regex is better

*** Long-term
**** Performance and explainability
***** rename =explain_spp= to something related to global explainability and mimic model construction, since another script will be needed to conduct local explanations
***** add check to ensure start, end and pad tokens don't occur adversarially inside sequence -> =nltk.word_tokenize= already breaks these up
***** add predict function for both mimic and oracle model which does not need extra data to be loaded -> can also accept stdin as unix pipe
***** when comparing model performance with other studies, consider only lowercasing and not making unique the test set
***** check if packed sequences could be incoporated into model
**** Re-check potential pitfalls
***** add =with torch.no_grad()= scope indicator alongside =model.eval()= to perform inference/validation correctly and efficiently
***** replace all legacy =tensor.data= calls with =tensor.detach()= for safety and =tensor.detach().clone()= for cases where data is being updated
***** check code for =squeeze()= call which can be problematic for dim 1 tensors
**** Dependencies, typing and testing
***** precisely type functions and classes on-the-fly -> especially for explainability scripts
***** include basic test code by instantiating class and/or other simple methods
***** add mypy as an explicit part of testing the source code
***** replace Union + None types with Optional type for conciseness
***** replace all =dict= types with =Dict= for consistency
***** look into cases where List was replaced by Sequential and how this can be changed or understood to keep consistency (ie. keep everything to List)
**** Documentation and clean-code
***** fix up filenames later on to keep things consistent, eg. =spp= vs. =regex_spp= vs. =spp_regex= etc.
***** clean out source code with newer and more efficient workflows, consistent variable namings and function definitions on-the-fly
***** add different usages for different types of models
***** TODO settle argument parser examples where some defaults are =None=, perhaps we could use another way to specify what default values will be chosen, or perhaps only leave arguments to =None= when there is no other semantic choice
***** remove cases where variables from argument namespace are redefined as local variables, a common example of this is with =args.model_log_directory= and =model_log_directory=
***** find better naming for mimic/oracle models which is based on research terminology -> right now mix of neural and regex is being used; it would be good to have something more firm
***** GPU/CPU runs not always reproducible depending on multi-threading, see: https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/notes/randomness.html#reproducibility
***** reduce source code lines, chunking and comments -> pretty sort python code and function/class orders perhaps by length
***** add a comment to each code chunk which explains inner mechanisms better
***** update metadata eg. with comprehensive python/shell help scripts, comments describing functionality and readme descriptions for git hooks
***** add information on best model downloads and preparation
***** add pydocstrings to all functions and improve argparse documentation
***** provide description of data structures (eg. data, labels) required for training processes
***** test download and all other scripts to ensure they work
 
** Notes
*** Research
**** SoPa++
***** extensions
****** leverage dynamic sub-word-level embeddings from recent advancements in Transformer-based language modeling.
****** modify the architecture and hyperparameters to use more wildcards or self-loops, and verify the usefulness of these in the mimic WFSA models.
****** modify the output multi-layer perceptron layer to a general additive layer, such as a linear regression layer, with various basis functions. This would allow for easier interpretation of the importance of patterns without the use of occlusion -> perhaps consider adding soft logic functions which could emulate negation/inclusion of rules, or possibly a soft decision tree at the top layer
****** test SoPa++ on multi-class text classification tasks 
      
**** SoPa
***** goods: practical new architecture which maps to RNN-CNN mix via WFSAs, decent code quality in PyTorch (still functional), contact made with author and could get advice for possible extensions
***** limitations
****** SoPa utilizes static word-level token embeddings which might contribute to less dynamic learning and more overfitting towards particular tokens
****** SoPa encourages minimal learning of wildcards/self-loops and $\epsilon$-transitions, which leads to increased overfitting on rare words such as proper nouns
****** while SoPa provides an interpretable architecture to learn discrete word-level patterns, it is also utilizes occlusion to determine the importance of various patterns. Occlusion is usually a technique reserved for uninterpretable model architectures and contributes little to global explainability
****** SoPa was only tested empirically on binary text classification tasks
***** general: likely higher performance due to direct inference and less costly conversion methods

**** Data sets
***** NLU data sets -> single sequence intent classification, typically many classes involved -> eg. ATIS, Snips, AskUbuntuCorpus, FB task oriented dataset (mostly intent classifications)
***** SOTA scores for NLU can be found on https://github.com/nghuyong/rasa-nlu-benchmark#result
***** vary training data sizes from 10% to 70% for perspective on data settings

**** Extension to new data sets
***** could extend workflow to ATIS and/or SNIPS since all other code is established

**** Constraints
***** work with RNNs only
***** seq2cls tasks -> eg. NLU/NLI/semantic tasks, try to work with simpler single (vs. double) sequence classification task
***** base main ideas off peer-reviewed articles 

**** Research questions
***** To what extent does SoPa++ contribute to competitive performance on NLU tasks?
***** To what extent does SoPa++ contribute to improved explainability by simplification?
***** What interesting and relevant explanations does SoPa++ provide on NLU task(s)?

****** 20-90 pages thesis length -> try to keep ideas well-motivated yet succinct
***** Feedback-based
****** General
******* make abstract more specific in terms of "highly performant"
******* fix absolute terms such as "automated reasoning", or quote directly from paper
******* re-consider reference to Transformers for dynamic sub-word level word-embeddings
******* improve capitalization with braces in bibtex file
******* clarify meaning and concept of "occlusion" as leave-one-out perturbation analysis
******* improve arbitrary vs. contrained oracle phrasing -> perhaps black-box vs. white-box but more specific
******* add more information on what competitive performance means (eg. within few F_1 points)
****** Visualizations
******* add visualization of in-depth computational graph in paper for clarity -> this can be automated
******* use graphical TikZ editor for creating graphs -> produce pretty graph to show processing
******* produce visualization of training performance using python frameworks rather than R
******* produce visualizations of regex ensembles which would be interesting, and also pattern activations
****** Quantization/Binarization
******* cite and explain straight-through estimation (STE), and what benefits this is supposed to bring
******* how does binarizing help with explainability, justify requirement for it in both training and testing
****** Explainability
******* qualify what does it mean to be explainable and how to define this 
******* expound on trade-off between performance and explainability and process of mimic extraction
******* mention that explainability focuses on exposing the model's logic and not on necessarily creating rationality in the model
******* how can a user make use of the mimic model and what benefits are there for the user in terms of security/safety/etc?
******* look at correctly classified samples and see if explanations make sense in general, also can do the same for wrongly classified examples
******* make claim that SoPa++ explainability is different from that of vanilla SoPa, but don't necessarily say it is better
******** make hierarchy for local vs. global explainability -> can provide hints of differences here
******** explainability is only relevant if the oracle and mimic models both *perform competitively and have similar confusion matrix profiles*       
******** provide some metrics or tangible task-based insights to show how new explainability works
****** Further work
******* mention about how it is not easy to evaluate the "quality of explainability" and to say one explainability is better than the other -> aside from a theoretical perspective
******* perhaps suggest how this explainability could be evaluated via conducting a survey and getting rating from people
******* porting this technique to a transformer where possible -> but mention limitations of everything being context dependent
***** Own-thoughts
****** read paper again to get some familiarity with terms and algorithms
****** provide evidence for why different forms of compression improve explainable model performance 
****** can map linear to decision tree as extra work
****** make comparison of single-threaded sequential speeds of both model over test set
****** show possibilities of fixing errors on the test set with general changes to the regex model which are much easier to do compared to the tensor model
****** show cases where we could avoid adversarial cases using the insight of the regex model
****** would be interesting to deterministically export which patterns for sure lead to which class, could help to identify adversarial samples via tinkering
****** add information on memory compression resulting from regex compression methods
****** compare oracle performance with those from other papers
****** semirings, abstract algebra and how they are used for finite-state machines in Forward and Viterbi algorithms -> go deeper into this to get some background
****** use more appropriate and generalized semiring terminology from Peng et al. 2019 -> more generalized compared to SoPa paper
****** Chomsky hierarchy of languages -> might be relevant especially relating to CFGs
****** FSA/WFSAs -> input theoretical CS, mathematics background to describe these
****** ANN's historical literature -> describe how ANNs approximate symbolic representations
****** extension/recommendations -> transducer for seq2seq tasks

** Legacy
*** Interpretable RNN architectures
**** State-regularized-RNNs (SR-RNNs)
***** good: very powerful and easily interpretable architecture with extensions to NLP and CV
***** good: simple code which can probably be ported to PyTorch relatively quickly
***** good: contact made with author and could get advice for possible extensions
***** problematic: code is outdated and written in Theano, TensorFlow version likely to be out by end of year
***** problematic: DFA extraction from SR-RNNs is clear, but DPDA extraction/visualization from SR-LSTMs is not clear probably because of no analog for discrete stack symbols from continuous cell (memory) states
***** possible extensions: port state-regularized RNNs to PyTorch (might be simple since code-base is generally simple), final conversion to REs for interpretability, global explainability for natural language, adding different loss to ensure words cluster to same centroid as much as possible -> or construct large automata, perhaps pursue sentiment analysis from SR-RNNs perspective instead and derive DFAs to model these
**** Rational recurences (RRNNs)
***** good: code quality in PyTorch, succinct and short
***** good: heavy mathematical background which could lend to more interesting mathematical analyses
***** problematic: seemingly missing interpretability section in paper -> theoretical and mathematical, which is good for understanding
***** problematic: hard to draw exact connection to interpretability, might take too long to understand everything
**** Finite-automation-RNNs (FA-RNNs)
***** source code likely released by November, but still requires initial REs which may not be present -> might not be the best fit
***** FA-RNNs involving REs and substitutions could be useful extensions as finite state transducers for interpretable neural machine translation

*** Interpretable surrogate extraction
***** overall more costly and less chance of high performance       
***** FSA/WFSA extraction
****** spectral learning, clustering
****** less direct interpretability
****** more proof of performance needed -> need to show it is better than simple data learning

*** Neuro-symbolic paradigms
***** research questions
****** can we train use a neuro-symbolic paradigm to attain high performance (similar to NNs) for NLP task(s)?
****** if so, can this paradigm provide us with greater explainability about the inner workings of the model?

*** Neural decision trees
***** decision trees are the same as logic programs -> the objective should be to learn logic programs
***** hierarchies are constructed in weight-space which lends itself to non-sequential models very well -> but problematic for token-level hierarchies
***** research questions
****** can we achieve similar high performance using decision tree distillation techniques (by imitating NNs)?
****** can this decision tree improve interpretability/explainability?
****** can this decision tree distillation technique outperform simple decision tree learning from training data?

*** Inductive logic on NLP search spaces
***** can potentially use existing IM models such as paraphrase detector for introspection purposes in thesis
***** n-gram power sets to explore for statistical artefacts -> ANNs can only access the search space of N-gram power sets -> solution to NLP tasks must be a statistical solution within the power sets which links back to symbolism
***** eg. differentiable ILP from DeepMind
***** propositional logic only contains atoms while predicate/first-order logic contain variables
