## Notes

### Tasks

1.  Slides

    1.  **TODO** Discussion (\~3 slides)

        1.  check if we can find stronger inductive biases to discuss,
            such as pronouns or gender

        2.  we can also go into USA centric pronouns and digital
            formatting

    2.  Conclusions (\~1 slide)

    3.  Future work (\~2 slides)

    4.  Do spell-check of all slides

        **DEADLINE:** *\<2021-07-04 Sun>*

2.  Do timed practice to hit 20 minutes

    1.  complete animations of slides

        1.  consider using stepwise tikz rectangles for CGs

    2.  practice will help fine-tuning slides

    3.  prepare for counter-questions for additional 30 minutes

    4.  prepare extra slides which could help answer counter-questions

        1.  eg. comparison table of SoPa vs.Â SoPa++

        2.  perhaps information on target audiences and explainability
            evaluation

### Interpretable RNN architectures

1.  State-regularized-RNNs (SR-RNNs)

    1.  good: very powerful and easily interpretable architecture with
        extensions to NLP and CV

    2.  good: simple code which can probably be ported to PyTorch
        relatively quickly

    3.  good: contact made with author and could get advice for possible
        extensions

    4.  problematic: code is outdated and written in Theano, TensorFlow
        version likely to be out by end of year

    5.  problematic: DFA extraction from SR-RNNs is clear, but DPDA
        extraction/visualization from SR-LSTMs is not clear probably
        because of no analog for discrete stack symbols from continuous
        cell (memory) states

    6.  possible extensions: port state-regularized RNNs to PyTorch
        (might be simple since code-base is generally simple), final
        conversion to REs for interpretability, global explainability
        for natural language, adding different loss to ensure words
        cluster to same centroid as much as possible -\> or construct
        large automata, perhaps pursue sentiment analysis from SR-RNNs
        perspective instead and derive DFAs to model these

2.  Rational recurences (RRNNs)

    1.  good: code quality in PyTorch, succinct and short

    2.  good: heavy mathematical background which could lend to more
        interesting mathematical analyses

    3.  problematic: seemingly missing interpretability section in paper
        -\> theoretical and mathematical, which is good for
        understanding

    4.  problematic: hard to draw exact connection to interpretability,
        might take too long to understand everything

3.  Finite-automation-RNNs (FA-RNNs)

    1.  source code likely released by November, but still requires
        initial REs which may not be present -\> might not be the best
        fit

    2.  FA-RNNs involving REs and substitutions could be useful
        extensions as finite state transducers for interpretable neural
        machine translation

### Interpretable surrogate extraction

1.  overall more costly and less chance of high performance

2.  FA/WFA extraction

    1.  spectral learning, clustering

    2.  less direct interpretability

    3.  more proof of performance needed -\> need to show it is better
        than simple data learning

### Neuro-symbolic paradigms

1.  research questions

    1.  can we train use a neuro-symbolic paradigm to attain high
        performance (similar to NNs) for NLP task(s)?

    2.  if so, can this paradigm provide us with greater explainability
        about the inner workings of the model?

### Neural decision trees

1.  decision trees are the same as logic programs -\> the objective
    should be to learn logic programs

2.  hierarchies are constructed in weight-space which lends itself to
    non-sequential models very well -\> but problematic for token-level
    hierarchies

3.  research questions

    1.  can we achieve similar high performance using decision tree
        distillation techniques (by imitating NNs)?

    2.  can this decision tree improve interpretability/explainability?

    3.  can this decision tree distillation technique outperform simple
        decision tree learning from training data?

### Inductive logic on NLP search spaces

1.  can potentially use existing IM models such as paraphrase detector
    for introspection purposes in thesis

2.  n-gram power sets to explore for statistical artefacts -\> ANNs can
    only access the search space of N-gram power sets -\> solution to
    NLP tasks must be a statistical solution within the power sets which
    links back to symbolism

3.  eg. differentiable ILP from DeepMind

4.  propositional logic only contains atoms while predicate/first-order
    logic contain variables
